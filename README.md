# *Raina's* kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

A starting point for Neovim that is:

* Small
* Single-file
* Completely Documented
* Cool af

My little neovim setup :3
Took me forever to get one that worked but kickstart was really helpful

### ***WARNING*** This config has key remaps for the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) keyboard layout. I should have labeled every time I remaped something specifically for colemak, but use it at your own risk (if you also use colemak then that's really cool and this is perfect for you! <3)

## Generic Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - For my setup specifically, I had to do `npm install @microsoft/compose-language-service` and `yay -S stylua pyright bash-language-server` for some of the language servers and probobly some other stuff I forgot.

### Install Kickstart

> [!NOTE]
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, that's it | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

That's what I did :3

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `nvim-lua` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux  </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

#### Read The Friendly Documentation

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about a particular plugin check its repository's documentation.


### Getting Started

If you use qwerty as your keyboard layout then I recommend running :Tutor as it covers the basics

### Installation on NixOS

    Add this to your home-manager or your configuration.nix
```nix
    let 
        nvim-config = builtins.fetchGit "https://github.com/Wyfi0/kickstrt.nvim.git";
        ...
    in
    ...
    # Set a font to a nerd font
    fonts.packages = with pkgs; [ nerd-fonts.sauce-code-pro ];

    # Enable neovim and source my init.lua from my git
    programs.neovim = {
      enable = true;
      extraLuaConfig = lib.fileContents "${nvim-config}/init.lua";
    };

    # Put the rest of the nvim config files into .config
    xdg.configFile."nvim".source = nvim-config;

    # And add these to either your home.packages or system.packages
    gcc
    fd
    unzip
    ripgrep
    nodejs # For npm
    go
    stylua
    pyright
    bash-language-server
    nil
    rustup
    cliphist
    hyprls
```

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing Neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
    * This is what I did at first to test it out!
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information
    * lol why
* Why is the kickstart `init.lua` a single file? Wouldn't it make sense to split it into multiple files?
  * The main purpose of kickstart is to serve as a teaching tool and a reference
    configuration that someone can easily use to `git clone` as a basis for their own.
    As you progress in learning Neovim and Lua, you might consider splitting `init.lua`
    into smaller parts. A fork of kickstart that does this while maintaining the
    same functionality is available here:
    * [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
  * Discussions on this topic can be found here:
    * [Restructure the configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/issues/218)
    * [Reorganize init.lua into a multi-file setup](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/pull/473)
  * I personally found the multiple file thing really confusing when I was first learning lua syntax and nvim shenanagins. (But now the single file setup is a *little* cumbersome)
